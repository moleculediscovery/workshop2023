### About

Recent breakthroughs in machine learning (ML) for molecules have demonstrated impressive successes, ranging from highly accurate protein structure prediction to assist the discovery of novel drug candidates and chemical synthesis planning. These achievements position molecular machine learning as a key tool for addressing pressing challenges related to drug and materials discovery. However, current machine learning - especially deep learning (DL) - methods, still face significant challenges and limitations. DL models are (I) data hungry while data in the molecular sciences are often rather sparse, (II) struggle with adaptability to changing tasks or distributions, (III) lack of (properly) incorporating domain knowledge, (IV) missing explainability and inherent differentiation of causation from correlation. Additionally, given the flood of new published methods, thorough benchmarks as well as regulations for deployments and sustainability are needed. 

This workshop aims to address the current limitations and capabilities of machine learning methods for molecules by (i) critically assessing them both theoretically and in applied and industrial settings, and (ii) showcasing novel and promising approaches to accelerate molecule discovery. Moreover, we will explore how recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) may have the potential to revolutionize the field. 

We encourage contributions that focus on robust architectures capable of handling domain shifts, novel chemical series, and diverse types of molecules. We also welcome methods that enable quick adaptation to newly acquired data, leveraging few- and zero-shot learning approaches. Furthermore, we aim to explore novel strategies for abstracting molecule representations, empowering broader generalization capabilities. Promising directions involve developing machine learning methods for creating relevant physical abstractions to enhance molecular dynamics simulations or force fields, as well as strategies to tackle automated design-make-test-analyze cycles.

Join us at this workshop, where experts from diverse fields, including ML, molecular sciences, and LLMs, will collaborate to overcome current limitations, explore new possibilities, and chart the future of molecular machine learning. Together, we aim to accelerate the discovery of functional molecules, revolutionize drug development, secure our food supply, and drive sustainable energy conversion and storage, ultimately shaping a better future for humanity.

Published benchmark studies have employed a wide range of datasets, cross-validation methodologies, and evaluation metrics. While variety is important, it is essential that benchmarks provide an accurate reflection of model performance. Unfortunately, many papers that compare ML methods and/or molecular representations use highly flawed datasets and fail to employ appropriate statistical methods. Datasets considered “standards” in the field contain numerous errors which may not be apparent to non-experts. These errors compromise and may invalidate method comparisons. In addition, many papers either ignore or inappropriately apply statistical tests for comparing distributions. Reported differences between methods often evaporate when exposed to statistical scrutiny. For the field to progress, we must establish standards and develop an evaluation framework that authors, reviewers, and journal editors can use. This will require a concerted, collaborative effort between domain experts, machine learning practitioners, and statisticians. This presentation will highlight prevalent issues with published benchmarking studies and suggest a path forward.</details>  |
